## About
This mod modifies the stock buy menu the player uses to purchase equipment from the trader.  It modifies the quick change perk buttons into filters which are used to only display weapons corresponding to the selected perk as opposed to the entire weapon list.  The filtered list is also sorted alphabetically to enable easier searching.
